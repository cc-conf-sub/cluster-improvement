Data Format:
* Data files are stored in Data/[name of data set]/graph.txt
  * All data sets are either publicly available, provided here, or the code used to generate them is provided
  * We provide data set samples to show the format for the various experiments 
* Delimiter is hard-coded in driver files
* For 0/1 Correlation Clustering: 
  * The first line of the file must contain the total number of nodes (anything that follows it on the line will be ignored)
  * Rest of file lists positive edges as [node1] [node2]
* For Consensus Clustering, no header line is needed
  * File contains categorical data, which will be interpreted into input clusterings

To Compile: javac *.java
To Run: java [DriverName] [data set folder name]
* additional heap space may be needed for some experiments; increase the max heap size with the -Xmx flag

Drivers
-------

Hard coded parameters:
* delimiter for data set
* number of Pivot rounds, number of attributes used, etc. 

RunCorrelation.java
* Input: positive edge list
* Method: "neighborhood oracle" for Pivot algorithm; also runs RILS, DILS, and LS
* Sample data sets: cor_amazon, cor_dblp

RunCategoricalConsensus.java
* Input: categorical data
* Method: precomputed edges for Pivot algorithm
* Sample data set: er_mushroom

RunFastCategoricalConsensusHybridRepresentatives.java
* Input: categorical data
* Method: "Pivot on the fly" for consensus clustering, using attribute sampling
  * Also runs multiple iterations of ILS per Pivot, wtih the same attributes that Pivot used 
* Sample data sets: er_mushroom, fb_government_consensus (generated by WritePivotClusters on fb_government)

Code Files
----------

Consensus.java
* Helper functions for Consensus clustering

DNode.java
* Implementations of LocalSearch

Helper.java
* Helper functions for reading data sets

Hybrid.java
* ILS implementations (calls LocalSearch on input clusters)

PKwik.java
* Pivot algorithm implementations

Data Generation
---------------

WritePivotClusters.java
* runs the Pivot correlation algorithm a large number (~100) of times, writes resulting clusterings as categorical data
* one attribute generated per clustering 
* Sample data set: fb_government

Plots
-----

local_cc_plots.ipynb
* Jupyter Notebook for data plots
